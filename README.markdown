Welcome to the Chatter REST API Sample Application
==================================================

The Salesforce Chatter API sample application is an open source MIT licensed application that illustrates how to use the Chatter REST API to build Chatter UI.  Use cases include integrating a Chatter feed into a 3rd party application or building custom / branded Chatter UI.  [Try it out here](http://chatter-api-sample.herokuapp.com).

Most of the application is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) for readability and portability. CoffeeScript compiles into fast and readable Javascript that runs in the browser. See the [chatter.js file](https://github.com/henriquez/chatter-api-sample-public/blob/master/doc/chatter.js) if you prefer to read Javascript.
